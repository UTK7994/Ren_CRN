Cognitive radios and Rendezvousity in channel Hopping

Cognitive radio networks (CRN) is an emerging paradigm to exploit the spectrum holes very intelligently.
To start communication in CRN, users need to establish a link on a channel which in not occupied by licensed user.

Rendezvous is an essential operation in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) to establish a link on common channel for data communication and control information exchange. To acheive guaranteed rendezvous in finite time, most of the proposed algorithms generate channel hopping (CH) sequence using all channels regardless of their availablity.

Thus, the CH sequence without considering channel availabilty information may attempt to acheive rendezvous on
unavailable channels that result longer time to rendezvous (TTR).

The implementation of rendezvous processes in order to minimize the TTR is a major challenge in CRNs.
Most of the reported schemes on rendezvous are based on central controller or utilize common control channel which not practical in CRNs
